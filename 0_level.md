## <ins>An Introduction to Programming</ins>

Before starting out in programming ,one must also understand that there is a difference between Coding and Programming .

### Question 1

> What is the difference between coding and programming ?

| Coding                                                                                       | Programming                                                                                                                     |

| Coding is a part of programming that deals with writing codes that a machine can understand. | Programming is a process that creates programs that involve the ratification of codes.                                          |
| Coding requires basic knowledge of programming skills without any software tools.            | Programming requires a good knowledge of programming skills and good software development tools to manage them in a better way. |
| Coding knowledge helps to work with simple projects.                                         | Programming knowledge helps to work with big projects and manage the projects.                                                  |

Next , after clearing the difference betweeen coding and programming . Lets see if you understand what is meant by algorithm?

### Question 2

> What is meant by algorithm ?

- A process or set of rules to be followed in calculations or other problem-solving operations, especially by a computer

---

Now we need to understand how an computing devices allows us to solve problems through coding .

### Question 3

> What is a turing complete machine ?

- Turing Complete refers to a machine that, given enough time and memory along with the necessary instructions, can solve any computational problem, no matter how complex. The term is normally used to describe modern programming languages as most of them are Turing Complete (C++, Python, JavaScript, etc.)

### Whats the difference betweeen compile and interpreted languages

| Compiled Language                                                                                                 | Intepreted Language                                                                                                                                                                          |
| ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| A compiled language is a programming language whose implementations are typically compilers and not interpreters. | An interpreted language is a programming language whose implementations execute instructions directly and freely, without previously compiling a program into machine-language instructions. |
| The code of compiled language can be executed directly by the computerâ€™s CPU.                                     | A program written in an interpreted language is not compiled, it is interpreted.                                                                                                             |

Now after these questions , we can now move to the next level because now you have an idea on what you can expect in this journey.
