## <ins> An Intro to Problem Solving using Coding </ins>

It doesn’t matter if you have seen the question in the past or not, read the question several times and understand it completely. Now, think about the question and analyze it carefully. Sometimes we read a few lines and assume the rest of the things on our own but a slight change in your question can change a lot of things in your code so be careful about that. Now take a paper and write down everything. What is given (input) and what you need to find out (output)? While going through the problem you need to ask a few questions yourself…

Did you understand the problem fully?
Would you be able to explain this question to someone else?
What and how many inputs are required?
What would be the output for those inputs
Do you need to separate out some modules or parts from the problem?
Do you have enough information to solve that question? If not then read the question again or clear it to the interviewer.
